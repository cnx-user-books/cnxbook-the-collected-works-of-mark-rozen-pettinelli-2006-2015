psychological problem, or someone looking to improve their life (only it isn’t a 
certain order).</para>

    <list id="id1166420993797" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
      <item>Social interactions</item>
      <item>Fear of social interactions</item>
      <item>Fear of the world</item>
      <item>If 3) what are all your fears?</item>
      <item>Could your fears be contributing to a deeper psychological problem? 
[Asking this question is more important than just asking "what are all your 
fears" or even "what are you most afraid of because it asks you to question if 
that is something you are really afraid of, if that fear is something embedded 
in your mind or if it is something minor. It also would sort out the root or 
tree structure that that fear is in in your mind (in other words, if it relates 
to other fears, events, or psychological issues).]"</item>
      <item>Do those fears cause anxiety only in the presence of the danger, or 
does it cause long term anxiety? [This is important to help identify how severe 
the fear is]</item>
      <item>Do you have any conflicts with the world, and are you at peace and 
confident enough?</item>
      <item>Being confident alone does not correlate with happiness, especially 
if your confidence is mis-guided (for instance, if there is a way in which you 
are being hurt that you are ignorant of, you may be confident, but are still 
being hurt). If you are in pain or suffering from anxiety, maybe you need to 
question who you are or what is going on with your life, instead of being 
confident and continuing with your current behavior. [This question ties into 
the next one a lot because being overly confident is more of a danger when being 
with people then when dealing with the rest of life]</item>
      <item>Does your personality have conflicts with other peoples’ 
personalities fundamentally? Although it seems that you may be socially getting 
along with other people, there may be a fundamental dislike that exists between 
you and some other people that is being overlooked. A way to look further into 
this is to ask, if me and such and such a person were to be friends, how would 
that interaction go? If we were to interact for a very long time (if we just 
were together not necessarily as friends) how would they feel about me then? 
Looking at it that way would enhance whatever is going on between the two 
people, possibly uncovering a potential conflict. [No one is going to get along 
with everyone, but if you look closely at the people you most disagree with you 
might learn something about yourself which could help you to adapt if there is a 
conflict, you shouldn't ignore something and let hate brew unconsciously, those 
deeper fears should be explored just as much as things you love since they might 
be just as significant]</item>
      <item>Your problem probably is going to originate from some combination of 
the three following sources A) a social problem with other people, or a deeper 
issue with who other people are vs. yourself B) a problem with the rest of the 
world (not social) like work or ordinary things and C) an internal problem 
resulting from how your process the world, the specific way in which your 
thinking occurs or how your feelings occur, if they occur as a disruptive 
process or a helpful one. [If you classify your fears it might help show how 
they are just that classification, like a social problem would then become "just 
a social problem"]</item>
      <item>If your problem doesn’t originate from a social source, maybe it is 
from a logic problem, things in your brain aren’t being processed in a clear, 
logical manner and the resulting confusion (say from a number of problems that 
you can’t resolve, culminating in a lot of frustration) is devastating, yet 
could be resolved by simple clear thinking. [In other words, maybe your fears 
are so deep it is affecting how you think on a basic simple level even]</item>
      <item>If the anxiety is from something in specific which you can identify, 
then how is this anxiety being produced exactly (what combination of thoughts, 
feelings, emotions and real world events lead to this happening) and how can you 
interrupt that process? [This applies to specific problems you can identify, not 
deeper psychological issues]</item>
      <item>Is there a relationship between your individual instances of short 
term anxiety? Do they all stem from a deeper psychological problem? (Something 
like, problems with social interactions, deeper issues with other people, issues 
with the world, issues with yourself) [You could try to fit together all your 
anxiety like a puzzle to see if anything relates]</item>
      <item>Are you getting what you want out of life? Does your problem come 
from frustration?</item>
      <item>Are you letting yourself suffer in your own pain, or is your 
attitude one which shows you are open to improving your life?</item>
      <item>Are you confident in yourself, but not being confident in a way that 
would cause psychological problems (such as hating other people or the world, 
but still being confident in that)? To live a peaceful, happy life only 
confidence isn’t going to make you be in harmony with the world. Confidence is 
necessary for happiness, but if there are deep problems you are ignoring, those 
problems could cause pain. If those problems aren’t internal problems with how 
you process the world, or a dislike of non social aspects of the world (such as 
work) then you could have an even violent disconnection or tension with other 
people, which could result from you being confident, only in the wrong way. Your 
confidence needs to be one which is compatible with the world.</item>
      <item>If you are not confident with yourself, you would have no reason to 
be happy or to overcome your problems, because you would have no motivation to 
do so. Being confident and motivated is necessary to overcome your problems, as 
long as you are not confident in an aggressive way which might cause problems 
with you and other people, or even mess up your own internal thought process and 
emotional processing. Being at peace might lead to more logical thinking, since 
peace is slower and more thoughtful than violence.</item>
