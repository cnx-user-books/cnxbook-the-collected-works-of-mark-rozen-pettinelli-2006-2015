  <md:title>How Does Cognition Influence Emotion? [The Book]</md:title>
  <md:abstract>How do our thoughts influence our emotions? Most of thought is unconscious - beliefs, goals, drives, appraisals, attitudes, and even changes in emotional processes (such as fluctuations in feeling) all can be conscious or unconscious to different degrees. But are these processes subjective or objective? Do some people respond to situations or behave more 'logically' than other people? Are there a few 'core' emotions that are the main contributors to our thoughts and the way we feel? Pleasure and pain might be behind our emotional drives, while more complex feelings would be the result of the other basic emotions. Psychology is a subjective subject, however it is possible to measure the emotional reactions that people have from their brains' mental processes (thoughts, behaviors, attitudes beliefs, etc).</md:abstract>

</media></code><para id="eip-890"><emphasis>Some mental factors (processes) are the link between cognition and emotion - such as basic imagery (body images), thoughts, and other cognitive associations and structures.</emphasis></para><para id="eip-414">How exactly does the mind 'think' however? I could say that it uses images to think, and that these images are mostly unconscious. That would be similar to having a dream, in a dream simple images represent larger psychological ideas and life experiences. The images your mind uses to think are probably basic, similar to how a computer works with simple switches at the most simple level. The most basic and important mental images are used to represent more significant psychological 'code' or life experiences (like body images - since social interaction is important humans would be broken down in the mind into simple visualizations).</para><para id="eip-703">So I think that the mind basically thinks by breaking down the psychological factors of life into more simple images. If you have an interaction with someone, then that interaction is broken down into more simple body-images and other images that represent what occurred in the interaction. These images are probably unconscious, you would not notice in what order your mind is going through them or what they are exactly.</para><para id="eip-362">This means that your minds cognitions (such as images and thoughts) are going to influence your emotions. The real world is broken down into thoughts and visualizations (or psychological 'symbols') in your mind, and these mental processes influence your emotions.</para><section id="eip-824"><title>Introduction (Part 2)</title><para id="eip-189">There are two major types of emotional experience - one is the obvious one which people experience daily and that is the major emotions they are experiencing as a result of their activities. The other type of emotional experience is one that is driven by deep unconscious factors, and it relates to your strong inner motivations, hopes, fears, expectations for the future, and how you perceive reality.</para><para id="eip-498">If you think about it, this makes sense. Emotion is generated by obvious factors - such as person A causes an emotional reaction in person B - and less obvious factors - such as person A has a strong inner desire to save lives, so when they see things that remind them of this, strong emotions are invoked. Emotions that are generated by strong, possibly hidden inner desires are much less obvious than emotions that are the direct result of experiences. </para><para id="eip-552">It is hard to measure emotion in both cases though. You can guess that if someone is doing a fun activity they are going to experience the emotion of 'fun' or other 'happy' emotions, but guessing what someones inner desires and motivations are is probably going to be much more</para><para id="eip-726">This relates to important concepts that influence how you perceive life, and how your emotions are generated. If you think about it, it makes sense that there are going to be emotional reasons you do things that you aren't aware of the motivation for all of the time. One of these important factors is a concept called "consciousness" - something could feel differently to you simply because you became more aware of it. The thing is new or different now. This concept of consciousness applies to all emotional things, you can become more conscious of one thing or feeling, or more conscious of yourself as a person as a whole.</para><para id="eip-9">I would say that how someone is processing their emotions changes how time feels, - their perception of time. If you are more conscious of certain emotions or just more conscious in general it could make any activity more difficult because you have to work to attain that consciousness. This is similar to saying that you should do an activity that is hard when it is least hard for you to do it. There are going to be certain conditions when things are going to be easier - - then your perception of reality and time might be</para><para id="eip-540">Another way of describing consciousness is just how clear a feeling or something is to you. If a feeling is more clear, then you are more conscious of it. This is like understanding why you like some things more than others, some things you know better how much you like after you spend time</para><para id="eip-801">I guess the question then is how is someone supposed to know when something emotional is more clear to them. Your emotions could be making you feel a lot of things that you aren't aware of you are experiencing. This is similar to having a hidden bias against someone or a group of people that you aren't aware of you have. I would say that you can observe these emotional phenomena through behavior, probably subtle behavior. That is similar to a painters strokes being influenced by their emotions. You can see how the painter is feeling by how they paint - their unconscious emotions are probably going to influence how they are feeling about the painting.</para><para id="eip-292">There are ways of interpreting cognitive information emotionally. Something can be imaginative, logical, happy, persuasive, or other ways in nature. For instance, something imaginative is going to make you feel differently from something that persuades you to do something by force. The 'imaginative' art or whatever it is is probably going to be much more pleasant than when your emotions and thoughts are forced or persuaded to think and feel a certain way. With imagination the thoughts seem more pleasant because your basically creating whatever it is you want to feel by imagining something. Even if you are imagining a nightmare the emotional process is still something you created and therefore subject to your personal bias (and people naturally want themselves to be happy). However, someone can easily repeat painful experiences to themselves, however that is different from imagination. With imagination you create the experience or magnify a real one. Magnifying a real experience emotionally is a part of what imagination is - maybe my point was just that things you create yourself and are more imaginative and probably going to be more pleasant.</para></section><section id="eip-590"><title>Decision Making, Memory and Emotion Regulation</title><para id="eip-561">Emotion regulation refers to the set of processes used in response to emotional
experiences and how we express our reactions to emotions (Gross, 1999). - This means that decision making and memory are going to be used in the emotion regulation process. A humans decision making ability and his or her ability to use their memory is going to be affected by the emotional nature of their experiences. Also, someone's personality might influence those processes as well. Someone who is action-oriented or harm-avoidant is going to respond differently than someone who might be more lazy.
</para></section><section id="eip-90"><title>Unconscious Processing</title><para id="eip-313">
How does the mind think? I said previously that it uses images to think, and that these are basic images like body-images or other symbols.
</para><para id="eip-743">But how does that information reveal other significant facts about thought? If your mind uses images to think, then a human's perception of the visual world is going to influence their mental thought processes.</para><para id="eip-831">Or maybe you don't need a visual representation, if someone feels something around certain nature scenes, like a pond, you don't necessarily need to visualize the pond. Being near the pond is enough to evoke the emotions that scene brings up because the pond creates a certain atmosphere, it changes the humidity in the air, and the life around the pond is different. So perhaps vision doesn't create most of the strong emotions people experience anyway.</para><para id="eip-272"><title>Is it Simple?</title>There is a way a human's mind prioritizes information. Certain objects in life represent different things and trigger different emotions for people. </para><para id="eip-633">People are also sensitive to different types of emotional information. For example there might be something difficult to understand emotionally that someone understands unconsciously because it is important or more obvious to their unconscious mind.</para><para id="eip-6">What types of information are understood unconsciously vs. consciously then? Clearly there is going to be a difference - I can think of many examples off the top of my head. There are simple things in life people do like knowing their schedule for a day, that could be considered to be emotionally simple, and there are more complex ideas emotionally that people consider during a day like how to handle a debate or argument. </para><para id="eip-612">Is there a type of 'emotional speculation' where someone guesses what something might feel like? You could say that people do this all the time when they make any type of emotional assessment (for instance how cool or uncool something is, or if they like or dislike someone). What is emotional subtlety then? It is defined by levels of conscious and unconscious importance, and degree of difficulty in understanding and absorbing the information.</para><para id="eip-677"><title>What information is absorbed consciously vs. unconsciously?</title>That is a critical question because there are many different types of emotional information. Something can be more important emotionally if the person simply cares about it more, or they could have a better understanding of the information because they have experience in that field.</para><para id="eip-2744">What would be 'emotionally complex' pieces of information then? If the information is complex is it easier to understand consciously or unconsciously? Dogs often understand beforehand when their owner is going to go on a vacation, or many other complex ideas about social interaction. Dogs also understand if a person is being nice or cruel to them - does that mean that a humans understanding of kindness is at the same level as that of a dog? There must be more complicated ways a human understands what 'kindness' or 'cruelty' means than the understanding a dog has. </para><para id="eip-240">Maybe information that is 'subjective' is information that is consciously speculated. Unconsciously you simply get a feel for things, but you can guess about a lot of things verbally - are those guesses instinctual, 'gut' guesses or are they measured assessments? Is anything subjective a measured assessment? Saying 'that coat looks nice on that person' is subjective - the person isn't doing an analysis of who likes the coat on the person and who else thinks it looks good. They think it looks good - they didn't do a study of what type of person thinks it looks good. The information is subjective, it was triggered by their own emotions and motivations.</para><para id="eip-681"><title>Is Conscious Understanding Subjective or Objective?</title>When someone thinks something is funny, how accurate are they? How can someone measure how funny a movie or a joke is? Can you measure that by the amount of time spend laughing or the amount of 'smiling' the person does as a result of hearing the joke? Conscious understanding of our own feelings is subjective. That information also means that all conscious understanding is subjective - when someone thinks they understand something, they are going to bias it in some way.</para><para id="eip-661">What if someone tries to be as objective as possible when making all of their decisions. Then possibly all decisions that are objective in the first place (non-emotional decisions) and not subjective might be fairly non-biased. But then what types of assessments are non-emotional and which types are emotional? Math isn't emotional - scientific fact isn't emotional. That isn't to say that there isn't a type of bias someone has when they do addition. Maybe they are thinking about something else at the same time and this biases possible interpretations of the objective data.</para><para id="eip-266">So it is clear that something objective is objective, and something subjective is subjective, however how could someone measure differences in how subjective something is?</para><para id="eip-692"><title>What Classifies Material as Conscious vs. Unconscious?</title>Theoretically all the information someone absorbs is going to be consciously vs. unconsciously absorbed to different degrees. I would say that if the information is easier to remember then you are using your unconscious mind (like how songs are easy to remember). Songs are easy to remember because they are fun, a persons emotions are evoked and that helps increase mental processing of the song so they can recall it. The emotion 'fun' from the song (even if it is a sad song the fact that it is a song is positive) or just emotion from the song helps you to remember it.</para><para id="eip-147">Information that you don't need to think about that much consciously is unconscious information as well. If you think about it, if you have to do a lot consciously - like think of this and that in order to remember something or think or do something, then it is more conscious. If it is done more automatically then it is more unconscious. </para><para id="eip-273">I would say that all emotional information is more unconscious. Dreams are emotional because you are not conscious during them. That is why they don't make sense, because you are not thinking (lol). Does this mean that someone thinking a lot is going to be less emotional? That is hard to say because you can't really define when someone as thinking a lot or not. If someone is watching a movie, they are probably thinking less then when during a history exam. </para><para id="eip-32">So my theory is that knowing how emotional something is can help classify if it is intellectually intense or not. For example - which would use more thought, a math test or a history test? In history you use emotional information to help remember the facts. What happened in history is emotional and social. Math is logical, it is clear how to get the result if you understand how things work in a concrete, straightforward way. (I am not saying that calculus is straightforward, I am just saying that it makes sense why it works that way because math makes sense). History is a social subject, however, so ones understanding of emotion and human interaction is going to influence your ability to do well in that field.</para><para id="eip-140">So which subject uses more unconscious processes? History or math? I would say that history does since it is emotional, and math doesn't necessarily engage any emotions. I mean, you are just doing numbers, it could cause someone to become emotional if it brings up something indirectly, but that would not relate directly to the math problem like how historical fact relates to social interaction.</para><para id="eip-117"><title>Emotional Material is Unconscious and Factual Thinking is Conscious</title>So therefore emotional material is unconscious and factual thinking is conscious. This is so because when you think about something you are thinking consciously, and that is a single point of information that you think as a 'thought'. If it is emotional or important it is unconscious because you can't think about your emotions, when emotions occur, they are physical processes that cause feeling. Thoughts can cause feeling, but only because they trigger emotions. So math is very logical, you can have a lot of thoughts about it but none of those thoughts necessarily have to trigger emotions because they aren't directly related. Historical fact is social, so it is probably going to be more emotional because it is more directly related to social interaction.</para><para id="eip-996">So a process like memory retrieval can be unconscious. When you are helped by your mind to remember a song, that is unconscious memory retrieval. When you try to remember something, that is more conscious. What is the line between unconscious and conscious then? Historical fact relates to a lot of things in your unconscious mind. If it relates to a lot of unconscious things, like emotional things or other things in your life you don't think about immediately, then it is more of an unconscious process. If it relates to things you easily remember then it is more of a conscious process.</para></section><section id="eip-516"><title>Representation in the Mind</title><para id="eip-781">Since different objects represent different things to different people, and there are different types of emotional  speculation (like deliberative decisions vs. instinctual ones), and various degrees of cognitive load (how intellectual or how emotional something is) then it isn't clear to me how these would function in the mind - which images, objects or experiences in life would do what to someone emotionally and intellectually?
</para></section><section id="eip-500"><title>Points made in this essay</title><list id="eip-167"><item>Mental images are possibly more simple in the mind than the full experience of them in reality. They are sometimes dulled down and made less intellectually intense like how dreams are more simple (and there are often simple images in them) than real life experiences.
</item>
<item>There are obvious and less obvious life factors that influence your emotions. This relates to having to do work to attain consciousness of something. If something is obvious or more significant, it is probably going to be more accessible to consciousness (how 'clear' something is).
</item>
<item>Someones memory and decision making ability is going to be influenced by their emotional reactions and their personality type.</item>
<item>A persons perception of the visual world is going to influence those mental processes (decision making and memory) because vision is a large factor in how emotion is generated, though not necessarily that significant.</item>
<item>People are sensitive to different types of emotional information and absorb some things better consciously vs. unconsciously. Some things are also more or less emotionally complex, in addition to being unconscious or conscious.</item>
<item>Unconsciously people can get a feel for things - that is what the unconscious is - more automatic - you could have a more conscious feeling for something but it is easier to respond instinctively. This relates to understanding information consciously or unconsciously, if feelings are involved it could be considered to be an unconscious understanding, like how dogs understand if someone is being nice. If it is conscious then you aren't necessarily correct, you are using intellect to guess at something. You could be using your unconscious feelings as well, however.</item>
<item>Information that is emotional (such as historical fact) isn't necessarily conscious thinking. One can think objectively about emotional information, and therefore it would be non-emotional to them. However, it makes sense that someone would use emotional information to help remember historical fact, since history is related to life and social interaction information (which are both emotional phenomena).</item></list></section><section id="eip-269"><title>A Related Article</title><para id="eip-122">Chris Fields (2010) wrote an article explaining about 'hyper-systemizers' - "Hyper-systemizers are individuals displaying an unusually strong bias toward systemizing, i.e. toward explaining events and solving problems by appeal to mechanisms that do not involve intentions or agency.". And how they are different from their opposites 'mentalizers'. That relates to this article because I described how some information is more emotional than other information. It seems that some people process more emotional information, and other people process information more subjectively or are just less sensitive to emotional cues:</para><list id="eip-136" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians rely heavily on a problem-solving and
explanatory strategy or orientation, termed “systemizing” by Baron-Cohen (2002, 2008), that is
characterized by appeals to natural laws, physical mechanisms, algorithms, formal inference rules, or
other concepts of causation that do not involve autonomous agency or intentions. Systemizing or
“mechanizing” (Crespi and Badcock, 2008) solutions and explanations are explicitly distinguished
from “empathizing” or “mentalizing” solutions and explanations, which do appeal to intentional,
2
autonomous agency and to actions guided by beliefs, desires, goals, fears, worries and other “folk
psychological” attributes associated with agency by a theory of mind (ToM) system (Frith and Frith,
1999; 2003).</item>
</list><para id="eip-6945">Fields describes the proposition of his paper:</para><list id="eip-496" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Based on a
review and synthesis of relevant literatures, the present paper proposes that pre-existing personality and
cognitive demands interact to progressively sensitize the attentional and motivational systems of some
individuals toward systemizing and away from mentalizing, resulting in hyper-systemizers who are not
deficit in mentalizing capability, but rather relatively insensitive to cues that ordinarily induce
mentalizing.</item></list><para id="eip-668">So some people are more driven by emotional processes - and their thoughts are influenced by emotion - but with other people this is less the case. I mean if your actions are being guided by beliefs, fears, goals, worries, etc. then it would seem to me that the person would be more emotional. That isn't necessarily the case, however. Someone could have their thoughts be driven by those things, but not be an emotional person. Would that person be thinking with more unconscious emotional processes, but not actually be more emotional? Emotion can be present in thought and used to assist thought, but might not actually make the person more emotional than someone whose thinking is more objective. Maybe they are emotional for a different reason.</para></section><section id="eip-459"><title>Theory of mind</title><para id="eip-506"><emphasis>Theory of mind</emphasis> (often abbreviated "ToM") is the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.—to oneself and others and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own. (Premack, D. G.; Woodruff, G. (1978)).
</para><para id="eip-872">In my view, ToM relates significantly to how emotional people and their thoughts are. If someone's actions are being guided by beliefs and desires (a 'mentalizer'), then it makes sense that their understanding and assessments of other people and themselves are going to be influenced by beliefs and desires. If someone has greater desires when making assessments (so the emotion would be related to their thoughts) would they be a more emotional person? Someone might be capable of thinking non-emotionally, even if they have greater desires and beliefs, though I would think that in general someone with more emotional thoughts would be a more emotional person. It probably depends what they are more emotional about, etc.</para></section><section id="eip-351"><title>Consciousness?</title><para id="eip-279">
A theory of consciousness is outlined by (De Luca, A Tony and Stephens, Newman L (2010)) - this is what they postulate - "To understand consciousness we have to understand the mechanism of its function, which is to effectively organize sensory inputs from our environment. Consciousness is the outcome of the process of organizing these sensory inputs. This implies that organization is an act which precedes consciousness:
</para><list id="eip-497" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>My hypothesis is that consciousness is
the emergent outcome of several linked processes (outcomes for sensory systems) which are organized
to form specific neuronal architectures. The most elemental of these processes is the electrochemical
input to the brain cells which originated as external stimuli on specific receptors that in turn generate
electrophysiological phenomena such as action potentials to occur in specific areas of the nerves
system. These ascend to multiply loci in different parts of the brain. According to some investigators,
i.e. Crick and Koch, it is the synchronization of these actions that results in consciousness. Crick termed
this the “Astonish Hypothesis” In this book and subsequent articles awareness and perception were
used interchangeably with consciousness. However, my hypothesis states that perception is different
physiological construct from that of awareness and are elements of the subconscience and
consciousness is the process of organizing awareness; its manifestation is the emergence outcome from
this process.</item></list><para id="eip-371">In my view, it makes sense that perception is different from awareness. Perception is fast because vision is fast. Vision seems to me to obviously be linked to different cognitions than awareness. To figure out how awareness and perception are different, however, we first need to figure out what 'awareness' is (though I would think that an advanced cognitive process is slower than a fast visual process, as it takes a long time to think complex thoughts). When someone is aware of their environment, is that awareness emotional? A deer or other animal doesn't necessarily need to engage emotionally with other species in order to be aware of its environment. Even frogs posses basic emotional processes (I noticed a from responding emotionally - when you go near it you could possibly try to be nice and not scare it away). What is awareness then? Is it just awareness of ones environment, or awareness of the social cues needed to interact with other species? This is in the abstract of the paper by Deluca and Stephens:</para><list id="eip-832" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Consciousness is “something” which the majority of humans know that they posses, they use it when they want to understand their environment. However, no individual human knows whether other humans also posses consciousness. unless some tests such as she is looking at me, he is talking etc., are performed. We are caught in an intellectual sort of recursive carousel – we need consciousness to understand consciousness.</item>
</list><para id="eip-997">So awareness is complex - you have to be aware of other people, what they are doing, what is going on in your environment. Vision, however, is simple. First people need to see their environment in order to reach conclusions about it (or whatever the equivalent that is that a blind person would do). If someone stops thinking, they could still be able to see. I am just saying it seems to me that vision is a more simple process than advanced awareness. First you see your environment, then you think about it. I would guess that when you aren't thinking, you are still looking around and responding to more simple cognitions that enable you to behave normally. Advanced emotional and intellectual thinking is probably slower than simple thinking and vision.</para><para id="eip-224">So no wonder Crick and Koch used the words sensation and perception interchangeably, when someone fist is able to see their environment, when they wake up or whatever, it is as if that is when they are first aware. (Vision being the 'baseline' cognition). This relates to emotional and intellectual complexity, some things are simply more advanced than others to think about. When a baby is born can it think? It can see, and it understands how to interact, but then again, a frog also knows how to interact and I notice they can respond emotionally.</para></section><section id="eip-535"><title>Consciousness in the brain</title><para id="eip-407">
Wallace, Dr. Rodrick (2011) sums up an argument by Atlan and Cohen (1998) about how information systems work in the mind:
</para><list id="eip-0" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Atlan and Cohen (1998) argue, in the context of a cognitive paradigm for the
immune system, that the essence of cognitive function involves comparison of a
perceived signal with an internal, learned or inherited picture of the world, and
then, upon that comparison, choice of one response from a much larger reper-
toire of possible responses. That is, cognitive pattern recognition-and-response
proceeds by an algorithmic combination of an incoming external sensory sig-
nal with an internal ongoing activity { incorporating the internalized picture of
the world { and triggering an appropriate action based on a decision that the

cognitive modules (UCM) that form Baars' global workspace/global broadcast.
That is, the remapped brain network is reexpressed in terms of the information
sources dual to the UCM. Given two distinct problems classes (e.g., playing tennis vs. interacting with a significant other), there must be two different `wirings'
of the information sources dual to the physiological UCM,</item>
</list><para id="eip-666">It is fairly obvious that there are different ways of responding to the world - social, emotional, intellectual, etc. - but the important question is: what are the similar ways in which different aspects of the world cause similar or different feelings? That way you could say - this is that are grouped in the mind because they have the same feeling (physical) response. Or is there "no room in any model for feeling" (Harnad, Stevan (2011))? I could use a emotional / intellectual division of world responses. While intellectually thoughts may cause feeling, it makes more sense that the mind is divided into emotional groupings not intellectual ones. That is because thoughts trigger feelings - a feeling can cause someone to have a thought, but that is only because you realized you had that feeling or it motivated you in certain way (while thoughts cause feelings directly). So it isn't someone's knowledge that causes feelings, I think the mind works by a more simple division of the world and biological responses - simple emotional groupings. That makes sense since humans evolved from lesser animals where that is more obvious. When an ape interacts with his friends, the emotion he feels is a simple one that derived from simple aspects of the world and the interaction he in engaged in. So while simple feelings might be the logical result of their corresponding thoughts, deeper emotional aspects of the mind are probably simple responses to the persons environment i.e., you went to a movie so you feel happy, etc. So my theory is basically only a few emotions are the end result of all our activities, and from these basic emotions more complex intellectual responses can be formed. Harnad, Stevan (2011) seems to feel that humans have little room for feeling in their intellectual responses:</para><list id="eip-850" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>And perhaps it is indeed
not worth fretting about the fact that, at the end of the day, the successful total
explanation of our know‐how will always be equally compatible with the presence
or the absence of feeling. For unless we are prepared to be telekinetic dualists,
according a separate, unique causal power to feeling itself (mind over matter; );
for which there is no evidence, only overwhelming evidence against it; there is no
causal room in any model for feeling.
Yet, although it may be an illusion that some of the things I do, I do because I feel
like it, it is certainly not an illusion that it feels like some of the things I do, I do
because I feel like it. And that feeling is as real as the feeling that I have a toothache
even when I don’t have a tooth.</item></list></section><section id="eip-6280"><title>My Theory</title><para id="eip-522">Paul Ekman did a study that found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (e.g. disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. His research findings led him to classify six emotions as basic: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.<footnote id="example-ffootnote">Handel, Steven. "Classification of Emotions". Retrieved 30 April 2012.</footnote></para><para id="eip-436">So there is a physiological correlate for each of the 6 basic emotions - my theory is that from different stimuli, different intellectual cognitions (such as thoughts, dreams etc.), and one or more of those 6 basic emotions (or possibly other feelings) consciousness arises. It doesn't necessarily have to be right away, it could take hours for neural centers to respond (in that way more complex emotional responses can be formed since they are possibly a build up of a few hours of mental experience).</para><para id="eip-247">This way, from a simple emotionally triggered response (not just emotional, but also intellectual stimuli and external stimuli) in the brain complex feelings arise. The answer must be that different chemicals are stored up over time. In that way only a few basic emotions could give rise to a rich conscious emotional and intellectual experience. Emotions trigger thoughts, thoughts are triggered from external stimuli (in any order thoughts, emotions and external stimuli can trigger each other) (which was triggered by such and such stimulus) could trigger this and that feeling over the next few hours. </para><para id="eip-359">Humans must develop a way of organizing the three inputs of emotion, external stimuli, and thought (the intellectual input) over time, and the way their mind organizes the data forms their 'consciousness'. - For instance, if you respond to seeing this object this way emotionally and intellectually - then that was how your mind organized your emotional/intellectual response. It is subjective to decide whether or not you were 'aware' of your response - humans respond to things all the time and they aren't necessarily aware of those responses.</para><para id="eip-365">So someone emotions could be sending signals to the part of the brain or body that registers those feelings. Your mind (thoughts, etc. - the intellectual part of your brain) could also be sending similar or different signals about emotion (i.e. 'I want to be happy' or 'I don't want to be angry'). As a third input, the person could be getting signals from their external environment telling their emotions to be happy, sad, etc.</para><para id="eip-24"><title>How can Intellect in the brain be categorized?</title>It is more clear how emotion works in the brain than intellect - the different 'main' emotions are obvious mentally and physically. However, how does a humans mind work intellectually? There must be certain types of attributes it associates with itself, and some of these are going to be more intellectually 'stimulating' to your mind than other attributes. This might also be true of other animals with less intellectual functioning than a human, however it is probably very different.</para><para id="eip-876">Just like how different types of sensory information can be stimulating to someone, different types of intellectual information are probably also stimulating to various degrees. School can be academically (or intellectually) rigorous, but what pieces of information from academic material are more rigorous? The same information probably is just as rigorous outside of a school environment. Can I separate out information that is accompanied or 'forced' into someone by other emotional stress like if someone was under pressure at school to do well, or under pressure to figure out a solution otherwise?</para><para id="eip-198">Different types of information must be associated with different emotional architectures - i.e., when I think about this I feel this way. Some types of information are going to be more or less emotional or related to your personal identity. That is different from if the information uses more unconscious emotional processes. Information could use emotion to help to think about it (like my historical fact example), or the information could be emotional to the person or not as well.</para></section><section id="eip-764"><title>Subjectivity and Emotion</title><para id="eip-866">(Vaknin, Sam) Proposes that emotions are either sensory or internal:</para><list id="eip-284" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Actions are sense data and motivations are internal data, which together form a new chunk of emotional data.</item>

<item>If more sense data (than internal data) are involved and the component of internal data is weak in comparison (it is never absent) – we are likely to experience Transitive Emotions. The latter are emotions, which involve observation and revolve around objects. In short: these are "out-going" emotions, that motivate us to act to change our environment.</item>

<item>Yet, if the emotional cycle is set in motion by Emotional Data, which are composed mainly of internal, spontaneously generated data – we will end up with Reflexive Emotions. These are emotions that involve reflection and revolve around the self (for instance, autoerotic emotions). It is here that the source of psychopathologies should be sought: in this imbalance between external, objective, sense data and the echoes of our mind.</item></list><para id="eip-790">So obviously emotions are going to be generated by either one or both inputs - internal and external. If you feel like (or are) responding to your internal motivations and feelings, then you are responding more internally. If someones environment is putting pressure on them (people in the environment, or other sensory inputs), then they would by definition be responding more externally.</para><para id="eip-470">What makes an emotion subjective? People feel emotions all the time, its just how they are - "Thats just how I feel" someone might try to communicate. It is too hard to assess where the emotion came from, if it was a logical one that made sense or an emotion that was subjective. What would an example of a 'subjective' emotion be vs. a 'logical' emotion?</para><para id="eip-4065">An emotion that is strongly influenced by a motivation or desire is probably subjective. An emotion that is sensory, like a physical emotion, is more objective because you aren't influencing the emotion with your mind. People respond differently to different situations because they are different people and have different background beliefs, ideas, feelings, experience, etc. </para><para id="eip-770">I suppose you could say that some people respond to social situations more 'logically' than other people. If they aren't as influenced by their internal beliefs - earlier in this paper I cited the definition of 'mentalizers' - people who have their actions guided by beliefs, desires, goals, fears, etc. vs. 'systemizers', who rely on a problem solving strategy instead of intentions - then does that mean they are responding more logically? Someones emotions could be influenced by logical data just as much as someones emotions could be influenced by internal intentions (though I would guess in general the mentalizers are more emotional).</para><para id="eip-315">Do emotions arise from a persons problem solving strategy? One that is logical (systemizers) or one that is based on internal motivations (mentzlizers)? If that were the case, then systemizers would be distinctinly different emotionally than mentalizers. Or do emotions arise from perceiving external actions differently? Perceiving actions would be learned from experience, while someones problem solving strategy is based upon what they are thinking about. - So emotions could arise from perceptions of bodily changes (which is Damasio's theory) which I suppose could be observing other people in your environment, or they arise from a more internal, mental process which is based upon what you are thinking about, how you are thinking, etc. (systemizers vs mentalizers for example).</para></section><section id="eip-647"><title>Observation vs. Inference</title><para id="eip-911">When someone observes their environment they think about it in some way. This type of thinking is different from thinking that isn't based off of immediate vision. How do the two types of thinking differ? What is different when you think from when you are observing your environment, versus when you think about things that aren't dependent on what you are looking at (a more 'inferential' type of thinking)? Fodor (Fodor, Jerry (1990)) states - "For one thing, observationally fixed beliefs tend, by and large, to be more reliable than inferrentially fixed beliefs."
</para><para id="eip-578">Based upon the same visual observations, will two organisms reach the same conclusions? Why don't I try to compare a deer and a human. There is a similar way in which both species process basic information about the environment (along with the animals in it), for instance if someone is attacking them both species recognize that as a threat. And i'm sure both species process data about environments without other animals or humans in it in a similar fashion as well. They both need to function in the environment, to look at the flora and fauna and decide what they want to eat, etc. It must be more complicated or 'theoretical' ideas that humans hold which separate our thinking from that of other animals (like deer). Here Fodor states that two organisms will reach the same observational beliefs 'however much their theoretical commitments may differ':</para><list id="eip-555" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>The claim, then, is that there is a class of beliefs that are typically fixed by sensory/perceptual processes, and that the fixation of beliefs in this class is, in a sense that wants spelling out, importantly theory neutral. A a first shot at what the theory neutrality of observation comes to: given the same stimulations, two organisms with the same sensory/perceptual psychology will quite generally observe the same things, and hence arrive at the same observational beliefs, <emphasis effect="italics">however much their theoretical commitments may differ.</emphasis></item>
</list><para id="eip-648">Is there a difference between perception and cognition? How someone perceives the world is based off of - and influenced by - how they think of the world. Perception is the organization, identification and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment<footnote id="examplnootnote">, Daniel (2011). <emphasis effect="italics">Psychology.</emphasis> Worth Publishers </footnote>. Cognition is how our minds use sensory data, in addition for being a name for all of a humans intellectual faculties - language, learning, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. So what is the exact relationship between perception and cognition? Here again is Fodor:</para><list id="eip-476" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Precisely parallel to the philosophical doctrine that there can be no principled distinction between <emphasis effect="italics">observation</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">inference</emphasis> is the psychological doctrine that there can be no principled distinction between <emphasis effect="italics">perception</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">cognition</emphasis>. The leading idea here is that "perception involves a kind of problem solving--a kind of intelligence (Gregory 1970). Perception, according to this account, is the process wherein an organism assigns probable distal causes to the proximal stimulations it encounters. What makes the solution of perceptual problems other than mere routine is the fact that, as a matter of principle, any given pattern of proximal stimulation is compatible with a great variety of distal causes; there are, if you like, many possible worlds that would project a given pattern of excitation on the sensory mechanisms of an organism. To view the mental processes which mediate perception as inferences is thus necessarily to view them as <emphasis effect="italics">nondemonstrative</emphasis> inferences. "We are forced ... to suppose that perception involves betting on the most probable interpretation of sensory data, in terms of world objects" (Gregory 1970). It is worth stressing the putative moral: what mediates perception is an inference from effects to causes. The sort of mentation required for perception is thus not different in kind - though no doubt it differs a lot in conscious accessibility-- from what goes on in Sherlock Holmes' head when he infers the identity of the criminal from a stray cigar band and a hair or two. If what Holmes does deserves to be called cognition, perception deserved to be called cognition too, or so, at least, some psychologists like to say.</item></list><para id="eip-289">So observation is similar to perception, and inference is similar to cognition. When someone interprets  or infers information, they are thinking - and when someone observes the world around them they could likewise be viewed as just seeing (or 'perceiving').</para><para id="eip-255">Which visual objects generate which cognitions? Or, which visual environments generate which types of cognitions? My guess would be there are visual environments that put a high cognitive demand on someone, or alerts them to a higher degree than less threatening or stimulating environments. It is interesting that vision plays such a large role in what a human or other animal might be thinking. For instance, a forest environment might make a human feel like it was under threat, or at least more so than a grassy environment where the human could see far around itself.</para><para id="eip-572">From the Fodor quote I concluded that it seems like the observations and conclusions reached from perception or vision are simple ones. Investigation into what is going on visually is just linking the vision of a scene (like a crime scene in the Holmes example) and with the knowledge you need to make the proper links. An understanding of of deep human emotional factors isn't necessary. However, a complex understanding of human motivation might be needed to understand complex ideas. Complex ideas might be linked to vision, however most things that people just see visually they don't need a complex emotional background to understand. There are many 'worlds' that each visual environment might represent. Those are also simple, however. In the visual field there are simple things like effects and causes (this causes that, etc). To understand the environment, much of the information of what is happening doesn't have to pass through consciousness since it is usually fairly simple. A deeper reflection, esp. a deeper emotional reflection is capable with complex thought, probably at a separate time from when one reaches the immediate conclusions they do about the environment.</para></section><list id="eip-133" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><title>Bibliography</title><item>Atlan, H., I.

 <para id="deletne_me">What is the relationship between cognition and language, and how do those processes develop?</para><para id="eip-717">When someone learns something new they are going to think about it in some way. Words assist learning, and the choice of words that someone uses is going to influence the meaning behind what is learned.</para><para id="eip-501">That isn't necessarily the case, however. It could be that your unconscious mind has an emotional understanding of the knowledge, and the words you use simply point to this understanding - and if you happened to use different words it could point to the same understanding.</para><list id="eip-225"><title>Words Assist Learning</title><item>Words assist learning everything - for whatever topic in life you think about with words, the fact that you use words to think about the experience or whatever it is helps understanding.</item>
<item>Although that doesn't mean that in every case if you think more with words you'll understand something better.</item>
<item>Life is about various types of emotional understanding, and words can assist or even possibly hinder this understanding.</item>
<item>So when a baby uses a word like 'goed' - that has an emotional understanding for the baby. The word might not seem to make any sense, but it means something to the baby.</item>

<item>Etc.</item></list><para id="eip-937"><title>Emotion is a powerful motivator</title>Not only does emotion provide information and drive for our thoughts and the words we use, it also motivates our behavior at the same time. Harré (1981a) claims that in the 'real' world, explanations are functional in a self-presentational sense. They function as a ritual display, as rhetoric, as show: they are designed to impress, and affect others impressions. And that people operate in a 'rhetorical impression manipulating manner'. There is a self-presentational motivation for peoples explanations (that is, someone has in mind their own presentation of themselves, what they look like, how they are perceived by others, etc when they make any explanation). Here Harré (1981b) tries to subsume all human affairs into a self-presentational motive:</para><list id="eip-381" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>What sort of statements are being made in concrete social activities, such as strikes, riots, parties, working breakfasts, overtaking in the inner lane and so on? Starting with these as rough guides: modern strikes can hardly be seriously taken to be economically motivated. They are best understood as claims to recognition and dignity, as displays of worth: riots too may be something like that: look at me, and take me seriously.</item></list><para id="eip-129">So when people think in social situations, their thoughts are probably mostly emotionally driven by self-presentational goals. This doesn't mean that all thought is driven by emotion, it simply means that a lot of thought is motivated. So I have brought up a slightly different question here - how much of thought is emotional? What is it like to have a thought be motivated by feeling vs. not?</para><para id="eip-408"><title>Classifying types of mental information</title>What are the different types of mental information? There are abstract concepts and objective facts - which relates to emotional information and numerical ability respectively. There is reasoning ability, and there is associative memory (which is basically linking similar objects together for faster recall). Reasoning ability doesn't necessarily relate to the amount or speed of someones memory - reasoning is something someone can think about by choice, while memory is less under someones control. A person could think of this or that in order to help remember something, however that wouldn't effect their measured I.Q. memory. Reasoning, however, is very subjective and someone could do a lot to increase reasoning ability.</para><para id="eip-80">What is subjective about reasoning information? It is that the information is about emotional material. Historical fact is about emotional material, and you could be considered to be using your reasoning ability when thinking about history. In fact, any idea related to human motivation is emotional and therefore subjective and subject to someone's reasoning ability. Unless someone uses reason to solve a math problem, or something objective, then reasoning is using emotional information and is subjective.</para><para id="eip-427"><title>Bibliography</title>Harré, R. 1981a.

<section id="eip-62h0"><title>Dreams rarely make sense because they are usually more emotional than logical</title>
 <para id="id10107057">Dreams in general tend to be weird. This would suggest that whatever engine is engineering, or designing the dreams is a weird and/or stupid one. Things in dreams often don’t make any sense in reality, but dreams are often incredibly sophisticated at the same time. This would suggest that dreams are emotional, not logical. Emotion is very complicated, but it often doesn’t make any logical sense. Dreams convey feelings very well, they amplify feelings, they don’t amplify logic. </para>
    <para id="id10107061">For example, say you were thinking about a toothbrush that day, or had a lot of thoughts about brushing your teeth, or had some trouble with the dentist and it was bothering you. In your dream that night, you wouldn’t think about the events of the day, or logically think about how you could fix your tooth problem. In fact the logical thing would probably never occur in your dream, that would be out of character since dreams are more emotional, you’d probably never dream thinking “ah I should brush my teeth more thoroughly”. Instead you’d dream of a really big toothbrush or something immature, childish, and extremely emotional. Or maybe get a large sensation of your teeth being brushed. See how one is more emotional than the other?</para>
    <para id="id10107144">Dreams are so emotional that there is little room for anything logical, it’s as if all your brain power is being converted into it’s emotional essence. This is easy to prove, think of any dream you’ve ever had, or ever heard of, whatever it was, it didn’t make complete sense. The fact that NO dream EVER makes complete sense must mean that the higher, logical part of your brain is shut off during sleep. That makes sense since if you were actually thinking, you’d want to experience real emotions and move your body around to get that experience, not just think about them. </para>
    <para id="id9285243">This might make dreams more sexual or Freudian, but more importantly anything that is most strongly emotional to the person having the dream. Take this dream for example “I was at a type of arena-ish thing but it had balconies like a theater would.” Notice first off that it doesn’t make sense, arena’s don’t have balconies like a theater would. Clearly if the person was thinking clearly she/he wouldn’t have been able to put theater balconies in an arena. Now there sometimes are balconies in an arena, but this person must have been referring to balconies that were pretty like they are in theaters with strong contrast to the arena, say like a stone arena with pretty wooden balconies in pink and stuff in them. That description I gave sounds like a typical dream because it doesn’t make sense, and due to the contrast/mix of the arena and the theater, it is very emotional. </para>
    <para id="id9285280">The mix of the two things makes it more emotional because it is something which you wouldn’t find anywhere in reality. Things that stand out tend to be more emotional, and anything that doesn’t make sense, like doesn’t make ANY sense, is going to be emotional because it stands out from your everyday experience. Something like a giant gumball rolling over and over in your head, that doesn’t make any sense, and its emotional. But why is it emotional? It is because you never find giant gumballs (that are chewed just standing around outside) so if you found one, you’d be in shock, and very emotional. </para>
    <para id="id10912950">There are things that are emotional and can be found in real life of course. Take this dream “I was a warrior in a med-evil battle with Mel Gibson and we fought some kind of beasts with our golden swords lol Mel got his head chopped off and I awakened when I was being choked by a med-evil beast. ...” It would probably be more emotional for the dreamer to be doing something with Mel Gibson, since it’s not likely he’ll ever do something with Mel and therefore would find it rare when he did, so it’s a not realistic, out of the ordinary, emotional experience. Furthermore they are using gold swords, how often are gold swords used? Gold is a more emotional color than steel as well. Color is emotional, so color, a dramatic color, or large color contrasts are often found in dreams to further amplify emotion. </para>
    <para id="id9959881">Take this dream, see how emotional it is, emotional, not realistic, and amplified for dramatic content.</para>
    <para id="id8085872">“I am the best student in a hard science class of some sort. Every day before class I hold study sessions. Everyone fails the first test but me. We are all milling about in the hall after class. The teacher and some other students express interest in the study sessions, but I say I don't really need them. They seem disappointed. Then I tell everyone "Hey, all those study sessions that I've been having... BY MYSELF... will still be there next week" inviting them. The professor asks anyone with a disease to hang around and see her in ten minutes, saying she has the shakes. She's very concerned with her health, which has been strange for some time. I think about staying, but I leave. I see Joe Horvath in the hall and hug him, but I see that he has a finger the looks like it was smashed and healed flattish and deformed. There are flecks of blue paint or nail polish or the nail is flecked blue. When I ask him about it he says he didn't even notice and doesn't know what happened, but it doesn't hurt.”</para>
    <para id="id10050683">The dreamer thinks he is the best in the class, not just any class, but a hard science class. He is so much better than anyone else, that he has “study sessions” by himself. Of course that doesn’t make any sense, the people were asking him about a study session, implying that a study session would involve more than one person, like they usually do. But in his dream he forgets logic and all of a sudden he is the only person needed for a study session, in real life he wouldn’t have said that because it just wouldn’t be a proper thing to say - he wouldn't say something that silly in real life. To make the dream even more emotional another out of the ordinary event is occurring: the teacher is feeling sick, and her health has been “strange for some time” not bad for sometime, but strange for some time, the word strange would imply something really out of the ordinary going on, like an extraterrestrial disease or something weird, the weirdness and out of the ordinariness being added for extra emotional content, of course. Does this mean that the dreamer is afraid of a strange disease? No it just means he is trying to entertain himself in his sleep by adding extra dramatic content by using the word strange, instead of bad. (it’s extremely rare to use the word strange when describing that one is sick, so what I suggested about extraterrestrial implications makes more sense). When you say, “oh I’ve been feeling strange lately” you are implying that something really weird is going on with you (or in this case your health) which would bring up further rise for concern, or a further rise in emotional, dramatic content!</para>
    <para id="id11193208">Take this dream “We’re in a hotel. We all have rooms, but we’re in Steve’s room. There are multiple beds that may be stacked. We are trying to make music. A boy starts playing guitar and it’s fantastic. Steve holds up my cell phone, it’s recording, he hands it to me. Steve asks me to play it back. There is a lot of music. One song my clarinet is so sharp. Steve says ‘if you can’t hear that…’ condescending. Steve leaves the room. We are competing for his attention, girls and boys. I am on a bed that is high. I know I’m the favorite and they’re asking me about it and I decide to leave. I slide off the bed, then reach up under the rail and grab a black candle (handmade) and a cigarette and something else.” That is also very out of the ordinary, in fact that would probably never actually happen in real life because everyone in the hotel would hear the music. The dreamer obviously wasn’t logically, clearly thinking. If she/he was then the dream would have ended with the people next door complaining about the noise, or there being somewhere in the dream something about checking to see if the hall was clear, but even then someone might walk down it. The point is it is very out of the ordinary, which, since it is rare, is probably more emotional solely because it’s a new and exciting experience that you furthermore can’t have in real life, so it also has that “I want it since I can’t have it” emotional feel. This is the real kicker, you can sense that the dream wouldn’t have made any sense if they actually checked to see if there were other people in the hall. It is only an ordinary, regular dream, if it doesn’t make sense. And you can sense that that is true. </para>
    <para id="id9309220">Let’s see how out of the ordinary this dream is. (All this so far proves that dreams are out of the ordinary, probably just to add emotional content because of the contrast with reality). “We are rehearsing. Instead of a lyrics sheet there is a flat piece of 3D art. It’s a series of concentric circles. One of the circles is made to look like a brick wall. That’s the verse I am supposed to sing. I get singled out and have to sing the verse alone. It’s about life going around and down forever. There’s an infinity symbol.”</para>
    <para id="id10801452">For starters there is no such thing as a flat piece of 3D art, 3D is 3D, but you can see how that would be fun for the dreamer to think about, entertaining for him to think about how it could be 3D, yet not 3D at the same time. This emphasizes the emotional content, but it low on the logical content. Why is the emotional content emphasized? Because dreams are for entertainment, you’re trying to have fun in your dream. So he/she mixes the lyrics sheet, 3D art, and flat together. That’s a fun thing to do. Dreams in general are going to be more on the fun side, less on the logical, ah this makes sense side. Take the line “one of the circles is made to look like a brick wall”. That just doesn’t make any sense. Exactly, that’s what is fun about it, trying to imagine something that doesn’t make any sense. Trying to put together in reality, things that just can’t be put together. It’s like you’re trying and trying to do something that just can’t be done. That’s behavior typical of an immature child that just won’t give up. It’s fun to try and break reality and put things together that don’t belong together. That way you create something new and different, something you’d want to dream about. People don’t want to think clearly in dreams, they want to relax, have fun, and do things that they never could in reality. See things they’ve never seen, and experience emotions that they aren’t going to be able to experience in other places. </para></section><section id="eip-291"><title>Dreaming and the Brain</title><para id="eip-268">

This system makes animals intensely interested in exploring their world and leads them to become excited when they are about to get what they desire. It eventually allows animals to find and eagerly anticipate the things they need for survival, including, of course, food, water, warmth, and their ultimate evolutionary survival need, sex. In other words, when fully aroused, it helps fill the mind with interest and motivates organisms to move their bodies effortlessly in search of the things they need, crave, and desire. In humans, this may be one of the main brain systems that generate and sustain curiosity, even for intellectual pursuits. This system is obviously quite efficient at facilitating learning, especially mastering information about where material resources are situated and the best way to obtain them. It also helps assure that our bodies will work in smoothly patterned and effective ways in such quests.</item></list><para id="eip-983">When the mesolimbic pathway from the dopamine-producing VTA to the nucleus accumbens is stimulated, SEEKING behavior ensues. Panksepp writes: "For instance, stimulated rats move about excitedly, sniffing vigorously, pausing at times to investigate various nooks and crannies of their environment. If one presents the animal with a manipulandum, a lever that controls the onset of brain stimulation, it will readily learn to press the lever and will eagerly continue to 'self-stimulate' for extended periods, until physical exhaustion and collapse set in. The outward behavior of the animal commonly appears as if it is trying to get something behind the lever."</para><para id="eip-559">The mesolimbic pathway is activated trans-synaptically by normal rewards (food, water, copulation) but it can also be activated directly by the induced rewards of intravenous drugs or electrical or chemical brain stimulation (Wise).<footnote id="exampfle-footnote">Wise RA. "Brain Reward Circuitry: Insights from Unsensed Incentives." Neuron. 2002; 36:229-340</footnote> The mesolimbic pathway is one of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain that modulates behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli.  It originates in the VTA and connects to the limbic system via the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex. A number of drugs are rewarding when they are injected into the nucleus accumbens and act as mesolimbic dopamine terminals,<footnote id="exampfte">Lassen et al. "Brain Stimulation Reward is Integrated by a Network of Electrically Coupled GABA Neurons." Brain Research. 2007 ; 46-58.</footnote>  and the axons of the mesolimbic dopamine system have high thresholds for stimulation (Wise).</para><para id="eip-879">Panksepp points out that when animals are in an appetitive state, anticipating a reward such as food or sex with a receptive mate, dopamine levels increase. But once an appetitive state turns into a consummatory state, dopamine levels immediately begin to decrease. So increasing levels of dopamine are not associated with consummatory, pleasurable activity. Rather the opposite is true. Pleasure is associated with decreasing dopamine levels. This does not mean that "reward" circuitry does not exist. Panksepp writes: "Temporal and frontal cortices contain an abundance of neurons that fire only in response to stimuli that have acquired meaning by being predictably associated with rewards."</para><para id="eip-785">That just means that once someone gets a reward they are satisfied. Most types of reward increase the level of dopamine in the brain, however pleasure apparently decreases dopamine levels.</para><para id="eip-931">Since humans think less when they are dreaming, it makes sense that dreams are emotional and not logical. I could say that they are driven by their 'reward system' when they are dreaming - the higher intellectual functions of their brain are shut off. They retreat into a more simplistic emotional state where they turn normal daily activity into some sort of silly movie.</para><para id="eip-415">During dreams, connection to your voluntary muscles is disabled. However, the person you are in your dream can move and it is as if then you can move your muscles in your mind. - REM sleep, the stage of sleep during which dreaming occurs, is characterized by paralysis of the voluntary muscles. Why? The phenomenon is known as REM atonia and prevents you from acting out your dreams while you're asleep. Basically, because motor neurons are not stimulated, your body does not move.</para><para id="eip-891">While dreams are often heavily influenced by our personal experiences, researchers have found that certain themes are very common across different cultures. For example, people from all over the world frequently dream about being chased, being attacked or falling.</para><para id="eip-910">So not only are dreams emotional, they also have a physical presence. - In your dreams you are really there and you can feel what is happening to you. That is why dreams of being chased, attacked or falling are fun, because you can 'feel' those sensations.</para><para id="eip-172">So in your dreams, not only are you using your imagination to run or move around, you are using your imagination to create worlds to run and move around in. Furthermore, these generated worlds are mostly from life events that are easily recalled in memory or simply more emotional.</para><para id="eip-656">So why does your mind make the dreams it makes? Does it select more emotional things to dream about or things that are simply more fun to dream about? (Apparently it does both)</para><para id="eip-46">So dreams are more emotional, and I think they also achieve stimulation from a more basic, reward based brain chemistry. The nature of emotion is reward based and simplistic, so it makes sense that dreams are that way since you aren't thinking.</para></section><section id="eip-8650"><title>Images in Dreaming</title><para id="eip-36">How does the mind construct images in dreams? What do dream images look like? This is a much more complicated question than simply asking if someone dreams in color or black and white. The mind could reconstruct video - like if you watched a movie clip and then your mind replayed it in your dream. But how would your mind reconstruct the movie clip? It would surely alter it in a way similar to how dreams are different from ordinary experiences.

<section id="eip-6210"><title>How can someone benefit from an understanding of psychology?</title>
<para id="deletbe_me">What psychological information could someone benefit by? How does self-help or therapy work? Those two questions are similar because through many self-help or therapy exercises someone gains a greater understanding of psychology. Therapy and psychology can help someone because they reflect more on their thoughts and their emotions and this helps to change them. There isn't any advanced psychology in non-civilized populations (at least I don't think since they don't have any education system), however they also don't have the same mental health problems.</para><para id="eip-221">But psychological information can be used for self-improvement as well. I should say that I am not a licensed psychologist, however I have a lot of knowledge and experience related to this. Clearly people learn from thinking about their emotions. Therapy or self-help is a focus on things you find important, like your mental condition. You could say that meditation works the same way - when you focus on yourself you can benefit.</para><para id="eip-442">Attitudes can take a long time to change. Emotion is complicated and dynamic. If you think about it, so is experience. But an attitude is simple - it is an attitude, everyone understands what an attitude is. It is a display of some bias or opinion about something. You have an attitude about something - you are displaying how you feel about that thing. You feel strongly about something, that is an attitude. </para><para id="eip-8630">So it would seem to me that things can go wrong mentally, resulting in a mental problem, if the feelings you have toward certain things are too large. You could say that the person has an 'attitude problem'. But attitudes are simple. How the mind functions is much more complex. But people don't care about how the mind functions, they only care about things that are important to them like attitudes.</para><para id="eip-413">It is like when someone has a psychological problem, their attitude is too large. This large attitude causes the emotions that the person is experiencing to go out of balance. Emotions need to work properly, if you are feeling too strongly about one thing this could disrupt how you feel in general.</para><para id="eip-915">So the important question is - how could an understanding of psychology possibly decrease a strong attitude? That doesn't seem to make any sense, it would seem like the only way to decrease an attitude would be to show the person the opposite attitude, which isn't really that deep an understanding of psychology, it is just a basic simple idea.</para><para id="eip-553">So then you could really call anyone that understands that 'exposure to the proper influence over time decreases dangerous attitudes and feelings' is a psychologist.</para><para id="eip-6935">Is psychology really that simple though? I know that there are lots of subtleties, but what are these subtleties about? People can be nice or mean in the wrong way. Depending on the circumstances, there are many different ways that someone can act. Each different way of acting socially could be analyzed and the person could work on that.</para><para id="eip-184">It seems simple when I say it that way, but that is basically what this is about. You go through an experience of practicing exposure to the proper behavior. You need to also consider the reason the person developed the strong attitude in the first place as well, however. The person probably wants that attitude to be strong, that is why he or she developed it in the first place, you need to consider that the person doesn't want to change and likes being violent.</para><para id="eip-264">I am not suggesting that everyone with a mental condition is violent. Maybe they are the opposite, it is just more clear when I use violence as the example.</para><para id="eip-558">That is why I said before that the emotions need to be properly balanced - because something like someone getting too violent can throw how they feel out of function. </para><para id="eip-41">But surely there is an aspect of self-improvement that an understanding of psychology can give you. It might help you understand emotion better. The question then is, couldn't someone get an understanding of emotion naturally or by doing practically any type of other work?</para><para id="eip-505">By studying psychology you make your natural understanding of psychology more conscious. For instance you might notice to yourself certain points of observation when you are in the real world observing how emotion functions. You might be able to describe with words better the nature of emotion or an emotional response instead of just simply having a feeling for it. </para></section><section id="eip-246"><title>What is Reasoning Ability? - A Subjective Article Relevant to the study of Cognition and Emotion</title><para id="eip-280">
Is reasoning ability emotional intelligence, or is it mathematical intelligence? The general answer to what is reasoning ability would just be to say ‘problem solving skills’ or ‘analytical ability’ or ‘deductive and inductive reasoning’, however how much is that really saying about what analysis is or what reasoning really is?
</para><para id="eip-740">There are an endless different types of intellect. For each topic, category, job, etc in life there is a different type of intellect or way of analyzing the material for that subject. Is there a generic 'reasoning' ability that applies to all of these categories or does one need to be defined?</para><para id="eip-961">Intelligence is very subjective, so it is hard to define emotional intelligence. However, I personally have found useful various tools that help my thinking:</para><list id="eip-237"><item>Categorize the information and make lists outlining the significant phenomena.</item>
<item>That means that if you are thinking about something emotional, what the significant phenomena are is going to be subjective, it might be useful to make two lists, a list with the significant subjective factors and a list with the significant objective factors.</item>
<item>Then you can analyze the information and say, ‘well that is pretty subjective, I don’t know if that is true, however if I consider this and that objective factors I realize that this and that subjective factors are more like x’.</item></list><para id="eip-739">How could someone figure out how subjective vs. objective something is? Facts are theoretically objective if it is a concrete fact that isn't, well, subjective. That is what subjective means by definition - something that is subject to opinion.</para><para id="eip-763">So therapy is subjective. When a psychologist assesses that someone has a problem, that is subjective. How is someone supposed to know if they are overly emotional in a certain way. Bipolar is a mental condition. If someone is bipolar they experience emotional swings from extremely happy to extremely sad. Does that mean that subjectivity is just about someones ability to measure emotion?</para><para id="eip-737">When someone says, 'this soda tastes good' you are measuring how much emotion drinking the soda causes you. That shows that a lot of the things that people say are subjective.</para><para id="eip-287">So subjectivity and objectivity relate to how the mind works, and the study of cognition and emotion. When people think things that are opinions of emotional states, or opinions of how much emotion something causes them, they are changing their thinking and possibly making their thinking emotional.</para><para id="eip-852">Why would it matter if a thought or just the words someone used was emotional or not?</para><para id="eip-392">Are the words people choose the primary factor behind what cognition is?</para><para id="eip-853">People have beliefs, attitudes, personality dispositions, goals, drives etc that all don't have to be thought about with words necessarily.

If you have a strong unconscious attitude towards a certain type of person, this might influence what you say when you meet that person, for example.</para><para id="eip-416">So when someone thinks about facts, these might influence their attitudes and other subjective unconscious beliefs more or less so than when someone thinks about subjective information.</para></section><section id="eip-629"><title>Psychology for self help</title>
<list id="eip-399"><item>People have a certain understanding of their own actions. This is true for specific, individual actions where you can understand to different degrees what you are doing and if you are conscious of what you are doing - and this is true with more complicated actions and behaviors (such as a behavior that you have to think about or reflect on in order to understand what your action was.</item>
<item>People have various beliefs about themselves, about the world, about what they are doing in the present time. These beliefs can influence your actions at any time. A certain belief can be brought up consciously (recalled or a new belief initiated) or a belief could have an unconscious influence on what you are doing. For instance a belief that you forgot you had or some bias you have.</item>
<item>There are only a few basic personality traits that people can have. There is their moral disposition - if they are nice or mean. There is their energy level, their nervousness, their type of intellect or way of thinking. There is their social dispositions - extroverted, agreeable, etc.</item>
<item>You can try and measure emotions in social interactions. For instance the emotion of love might only be present between two people who are in love occasionally. You could also try to measure it over a longer period of time, and try to observe certain indicators that point to if that emotion is occurring. </item>
<item>Furthermore, in every social interaction there are going to be various emotions interacting with each other. This is a part of the 'mood' or 'atmosphere'. For instance there could be a humorous mood or a romantic mood, or maybe those two emotions/moods are interacting with each other during the interaction.</item>
<item>This brings up the point that there are various ways someone can be conscious of their emotions. Someone may have an emotion, but that doesn't mean that it is easy for them to feel or understand that it is occurring. </item>
<item>A mood or emotional state consists of a certain set of feelings (happy, sad, exciting, etc), in addition to having its own unique feeling. </item>
<item>Emotion can cloud intellect. The various ways of thinking can be related to someones social disposition (if they are an introvert or an extrovert). Jung discussed the introverted type of thinking - '"this kind of thinking easily gets lost in the immense truth of the subjective factor... the extraordinary impoverishment of introverted thinking is compensated by a wealth of unconscious facts." (Carl Jung, "Psychological Types".) He seemed to think that introverted thinking was defective somehow, yet more internal and possibly deeper unconsciously.</item>

<list id="eip-755" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach that addresses dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and cognitions through a goal-oriented, systematic process. The name refers to behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and to therapy based upon a combination of basic behavioral and cognitive research.<footnote id="example-foowtnote">Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy 9/8/2012</footnote></item></list><para id="delete_sme">A major aspect of CBT is to use an analysis of someones thoughts and feelings - how their feelings lead to thoughts and how their thoughts lead to feelings - as a way to help the person understand how they can change their thoughts and how this might help them change their feelings. Obviously they also analyze how thoughts and feelings relate to behavior as well.</para><para id="eip-888">But how much of someones thinking is unconscious? Someone can have a thought that they aren't aware of. They could have some belief, attitude, or thought process that they aren't aware of. A belief is something you are thinking that isn't a fact - which would be something you know to be true (or think you know to be true). So when I say that you might have some belief you aren't aware of that means anything you think that you aren't certain of. I would say that everything in the mind that you think is either a fact or a belief, or a more complicated thought that is more like a paragraph which would be describing something.</para><para id="eip-254">Surely when you are interacting with someone there is potentially a lot of unconscious beliefs and ideas you might form about the other person. You could be biased against them and not know it very easily. In fact, there might be subtle shifts in how you are biased against them many times during a conversation. </para><para id="eip-689">But is that what the unconscious is about - beliefs, facts, and ideas that you have that you aren't aware of? Or is it about deep motivations and powerful emotions that are influencing your feelings, thoughts and behaviors?</para><para id="eip-560">There is a lot of mystery behind what is happening in your mind unconsciously. That is why it might take a lot of work thinking about your own thoughts and feelings in order to change them. If you have some strong attachment or drive that needs to be changed - it is a powerful unconscious one, and you would need to do a lot of work over a long time in order to change how you feel.</para><para id="eip-113">I am not a licensed psychologist, but it is obvious that certain behaviors or ways of being can only be changed over a long period of time. If someone feels passionately about something, this cannot change instantly. That shows how any behavior might take a long time to change. People get used to acting a certain way and this can only be changed by showing them or practicing new ways of acting. They have deep unconscious beliefs and attitudes that are strong and reflected in many aspects of their actions. Such complicated and subtle behavior cannot change instantly because it is too complicated to change instantly - if a behavior is complicated then it is going to take a long time to change because there are many things that need to be changed about it.</para><para id="eip-51">You might not notice all of the things that change, however if you think about it an attitude is probably going to have many associated beliefs and unconscious drives that need to be addressed. This is what experience is. It isn't simply that an attitude is large and needs to be decreased over time - there is also a learning process.</para><para id="eip-741">What can be said about this? If a motivation is large, then why does it take so long to change? It seems to me that if you describe the motivation as 'unconscious' it shows that it is very large, because most of the mind is unconscious. What does the word 'unconscious' bring up anyway? Is it merely a way of saying something is more significant than you would think because you aren't aware of its full impact?</para><para id="eip-100">Human beings aren't aware of a lot of things about themselves, that is why saying 'unconsciously' brings up so much.

<para id="deljete_me">In 1991 Barnard and Teasdale created a multilevel theory of the mind called “Interacting Cognitive Subsystems,” (ICS). The ICS model is based on Barnard and Teasdale’s theory that the mind has multiple modes that are responsible for receiving and processing new information cognitively and emotionally. Barnard and Teasdale’s (1991) theory associates an individual’s vulnerability to depression with the degree to which he/she relies on only one of the mode of mind, inadvertently blocking the other modes. The two main modes of mind include the “doing” mode and “being” mode. The “doing” mode is also known as the driven mode. This mode is very goal-oriented and is triggered when the mind develops a discrepancy between how things are versus how the mind wishes things to be.<footnote id="exampldtnote">Segal, Z., Teasdale, J., Williams, M. (2002). Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression. New York: Guilford Press.</footnote> The second main mode of mind is the “being” mode. “Being” mode, is not focused on achieving specific goals, instead the emphasis is on “accepting and allowing what is,” without any immediate pressure to change it.<footnote id="examptootnote">Segal, Z., Teasdale, J., Williams, M. (2002). Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression. New York: Guilford Press. p.73</footnote></para><para id="eip-137">Based on Barnard and Teasdale’s (1991) model, mental health is related to an individual’s ability to disengage from one mode or to easily move among the modes of mind. Therefore, individuals that are able to flexibly move between the modes of mind based on the conditions in the environment are in the most favorable state. The ICS model theorizes that the “being” mode is the most likely mode of mind that will lead to lasting emotional changes. Therefore for prevention of relapse in depression, cognitive therapy must promote this mode. This led Teasdale to the creation of MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy), which promotes the “being” mode.<footnote id="exampwle-footnote">Herbert, James D., and Evan M. Forman. Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Understanding and Applying New Theories. Hoboken: John Wiley + Sons, 2011. Print.</footnote></para><para id="eip-601">The idea is that in the "doing" mode someone is trying to get to a better state. Therefore tension is caused and they are likely to spiral back downward into a depression. If someone is in the "being" mode they let their negative thoughts flow and ignore the negative state. That way they can pass out of it easily.</para><para id="eip-340">I this that this theory behind MBCT is very interesting in terms of how emotion and cognition interact. If you think about it, your emotional state of being upset about something is driving you to be in a state that is seeking out an answer. I think this method of therapy is basically just telling the person to say to themselves, "its ok, i don't need to react to my feeling upset, I can let this feeling and the unwelcome thoughts it generates or wants to generate pass". </para><para id="eip-89">But is that the full mystery behind what is going on when your mind enters one of these states? Each of these states is responsible for your way of thinking and feeling while you are in them, everything you feel and think in these states is being influenced by you either being upset, or just "being" and letting the thing pass you by. </para><para id="eip-282">It seems to me like there are an endless number of other different "modes" someone can be in. They can be in a mode where they just want sex, for example. Is this just a different way of acting? It isn't. When someone is in a different mode, they want something, their feelings and their entire state is different, it is like they are a different person (for example 'bitch' mode). </para><para id="eip-346">So I guess then a different mode could be characterized by what happens in this mode. There are thoughts and attitudes that are characteristic of each mode. It is almost like a different personality, maybe sometimes someone acts nice, and in this mode they are really very different. But surely there are more modes than that.</para><para id="eip-469">I would say that there is a mode where you expect pleasure from other people. There is a mode where you are abusive, etc. Your attitude can change in many ways, and, in each of these ways, you are really in a different "mode" or are a slightly different person. </para><para id="eip-169">This is really a social thing then - you can be in a nice or mean mode, a mode where you are getting along with the people around you in a certain way. When someone is in the 'driven' mode of MBCT the person wants to satisfy whatever it is they are upset about. My point is that is just one mode of many different modes that a person can enter. People want satisfaction in other ways, maybe it is just in this mode that you are in a more extreme state such that it is directing your thoughts and feelings it is so powerful.</para><para id="eip-20">Emotion is powerful - these 'modes' are so powerful that they direct and influence your thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Emotion causes people to do things they didn't think about all of the time. Emotion itself communicates information  - if you are in this emotional state, you are being informed by your emotions that you feel that way, so you might learn why you might be feeling that way.</para><para id="eip-176">You could say that the unique feeling of each emotion communicates a unique understanding. Some emotions are so strong they make you go crazy and you really are in a different mode. I think this shows how emotion influences your thinking. People are motivated by their emotions, they think differently because in these modes, when they are experiencing different emotions, they want different different things, their desires and preferences are different for that short, emotional, possibly moody time period.</para><para id="eip-936">So in the "being" mode it is like you are just being, and letting the emotional power flow through you instead of having it control you and influence your thoughts and feelings and behaviors. You are not driven, you are simply being.</para></section><section id="eip-640"><title>What is thinking - or as scientiest name it - 'cognition'?</title>
<list id="eip-493" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>In science, cognition is a group of mental processes that includes attention, memory, producing and understanding language, solving problems, and making decisions. Cognition is studied in various disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, linguistics, science and computer science. The term's usage varies in different disciplines; for example in psychology and cognitive science, it usually refers to an information processing view of an individual's psychological functions. It is also used in a branch of social psychology called social cognition to explain attitudes, attribution, and groups dynamics.<footnote id="example-footnote">Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition 9/8/2012</footnote></item></list><para id="delsete_me">There are various things people can do mentally that have been labeled as aspects of cognition such as processes like memory, association, concept formation, pattern recognition, language, attention, perception, action, problem solving and mental imagery. Traditionally, emotion was not thought of as a cognitive process.</para><para id="eip-281">Most of those seem obvious - it is clear how memory functions, you simply bring up a memory. Well, you might need to be in the right emotional state in order to bring up the proper memory. Sometimes certain memories are easier to recall than at other times, this is probably because you were thinking of closely associated things that helped you to recall the similar memory. Sometimes people might need to spend some time trying to pull up a memory.</para><para id="eip-443">Actually, now that I think about it, you could probably go into great detail describing how memory functions - however on the surface and for the most part it is simple and easily understood. People use their memories all of the time, so in a way everyone understands how memory works.</para><para id="eip-990">However, when you think anything aspects of memory are probably used because it is related to what you did earlier that day. When you say 'hi' to someone, or do anything really, you use your memory to compare that event to previous events in your life or earlier that day. Your mind is like a computer, there are lots of things it is comparing and contrasting all of the time.</para><para id="eip-2374">How does this process work? It probably works emotionally as well as intellectually. Your emotions help you bring up other similarly emotional memories and associated thoughts. Each emotion means something - it has a symbolic representation like saying hi brings up the emotion for people or the idea you have of people in your mind.</para><para id="eip-200">But the interesting thing is how memory or thought relates to mental imagery. I said that emotion can be used to compare different thoughts and memories, but is mental imagery also involved there? There are going to be mental images associated with memories, thoughts and emotions. Therefore your mind is really comparing and contrasting lots of different thoughts, sensations, images, memories, and feelings all of the time. </para><para id="eip-523">An image means something. This is obvious if you think about art. People can 'think' visually basically. People can also think with their emotions, as it is clear that emotion can be informative. A thought could be of an event, a memory, a group of related ideas, a group of not related ideas, an emotion. How could a thought be of an emotion? All emotions mean something, a thought that is of an emotion is just then an emotion with special significance that you have drawn more attention to in the form of a thought. </para><para id="eip-486">So a conscious thought is something that is clear to you. An unconscious thought is something that simply means something to you - it could be anything really. Anything that communicates information to your mind. Thought is really then informative, and the function of emotion then is simply to experience feeling.</para><para id="eip-524">But what kinds of information does thought communicate? It can communicate visual information, mathematical information, emotional information, various ideas and concepts, sensations, experiences, physical feelings and actions, mental feelings and actions, sounds - everything there is in existence that your mind can understand.</para>
</section><section id="eip-6310"><title>Some Points on emotion theory</title>
<list id="eip-882"><item>There are two types of observations in emotion theory, one type is general common observations (such as sex is good for someones emotional health) and the other type is functional observations (when an emotion stops at one second and another one takes its place, what is happening there, what are the emotions, why do they stop and start, etc (for example, if someone thinks a happy thought it might stop the negative thought completely) also, what are the degrees to which the emotion or thought is felt, is it completely gone etc.</item>
	<item>Emotions stop and start all the time, this stopping and starting might occur as sudden transitions or slow transitions, one emotion gradually fading into the other. That is not a complete explanation for how emotion functions, however. Humans would probably have several emotions occurring at one time, each emotion interacting with one or more other emotions and potentially causing them to stop, start, fade or increase.</item>
	<item>For instance, the emotions hate, love, painful emotions, sexual emotions, hopeful emotions, and humorous emotions are probably all constantly interacting with each other and being felt to some degree all the time. Those are only a few of the emotions/feelings that are probably felt a lot everyday.</item>
<item>There are going to be observable patterns that occur with those emotions, for instance pleasure might relieve pain and make painful feeling go away.</item>
<item>Life is intense and ongoing, so therefore intense emotion is probably maintained in humans all the time. These emotions might stop and start, someone could go from brief periods of intensity to periods of low intensity, but the point is there is that intensity that is felt and the continuous flow of emotional processing is ongoing.</item>
<item>There are different emotional states that can change your outlook on life or how you might respond to a situation. Fear, anger, kindness and admiration are all emotional states that change how you might respond to events. You can also be in a state of readiness for certain emotions, you could be prepared to experience pain or pleasure or be in one of those states.</item>
<item>Emotions are experienced consciously and unconsciously, the extent to which someone clearly feels an emotion is the extent to which it is conscious. If an emotion is being experienced but isn't under the awareness of the person experiencing it, by definition it is mostly an unconscious emotion because they are not conscious of it. Someone can experience a large emotion but that doesn't necessarily mean that the emotion is going to be completely under the awareness of the person experiencing it. They might describe the emotion as feeling like it is very large, but they might not be in touch with it (making it mostly unconscious). It is in this world of "seemingly larger emotions" that emotional processing takes place. Unconsciously there are many more emotions experienced than you are completely aware of that are being experienced. Therefor it is there, in the unconscious mind, that emotions interact in great depth and complexity, barely being felt consciously at times and with the person possibly only slightly aware that something emotional might be going on (unconsciously).</item>
<item>Emotion is experienced differently for each person. An emotion evokes a certain emotional response in a person because that person is who they are, however we all share the same world and there are going to be significant psychological things in it that are generally considered to be significant by most people, such as death or love. Any individual has peculiarities and specifics about what might trigger a large emotional response, it wouldn't necessarily just be something that they "like a lot" but mostly things they consciously or unconsciously find to be significant.</item>
<item>When emotion can stop and start, and there can be periods of intensity and low-intensity, it makes one wonder just how many different emotional states there are. For every mood in a social situation you could say is an emotional state. If there is a certain mood present, then the people are going to be feeling certain things and responding in a way that is correspondent to that mood. But that is just social moods, there are many other ways people's emotional state can change, if you are working on something you enjoy working on you could be in a certain emotional state for that.</item>
<item>An emotional state implies a certain set of feelings that come up with a certain activity or under certain circumstances.</item>
<item>An important observation to note in emotion theory is that pain can stop the current flow of emotion or feeling and alert the person. Pain and anxiety are different from the other emotions because they are unpleasant. How often is an emotion like hope or fun tainted by the emotion of pain? Is fun even an emotion or is it an emotional state? Fun would imply that you are experiencing a set of emotions that makes that circumstance fun, joy is an emotion, "fun" is more of an emotional state.</item>
<item>The flow of someone's feelings can stop suddenly, for instance, say you are relaxing in bed after waking up, then your alarm clock goes off - you went from feeling happy, relaxed emotions to those suddenly ending. Emotions and feelings stop and start like this all the time. In a conversation, for example, someone could be happy and the other person could show or adopt a negative expression and that could suddenly end the other persons happiness. There are many emotions someone could adopt in a conversation such as shyness, or an emotion expressing a thought or an idea, and these emotions could influence (or start and stop) emotions that the other person is experiencing. It should be clear that the many emotions someone experiences throughout the day changes all the time, stops, starts, transitions, and changes in complicated ways all the time. These changes may or may not be observed, however if you pay attention to these feelings and their behavior you could certainly notice a lot more.</item>
<item>Emotion can motivate thought. People go into different states or 'modes' where they are driven to think a certain type of thought or do a certain type of behavior. When someone enters a different mode, such as a pleasure seeking mode, that mode in particular is motivated by emotion. It is clear that with pleasure someone is feeling more, so you would say that it is motivated by emotion. However, every state someone is in, every different subtle social emotional state or emotional state when someone is doing work is going to have some emotion or set of feelings behind it. But it isn't just a set of feelings, the feeling is unique each time, and this uniqueness communicates certain information that is also unique. The feeling tells you what you like and what you don't like, that would probably be the primary emotions (pleasure and pain). But each other emotion communicates something - if you feel guilty you know what that feeling means, maybe that feeling in combination with other feelings is communicating something different or unique based upon the set of feelings it is and what it means in that context.</item>
<item>Therefore someone could enter into a mode such as an abusive mode, where, emotionally, they are being abusive. It makes sense that since this is a mode, it takes a reasonable period of time to experience. It isn't an expression or a gesture, which takes a couple of seconds, but a mode like this my guess would be at least a few minutes long. Another mode could be a humorous mode. Maybe that is clear by the person being observed as being amused - but maybe emotionally they are amused for a certain period of time before and after your observation of them being that way.</item>
<item>That isn't to say that someone couldn't experience amused feelings for a few seconds. Clearly when someone laughs the feelings mostly only last for the period of the laughter. But they would probably still be amused for a period afterwards. You just laughed - and you become happy or amused for a short period after that. My point about the modes is that there are certain powerful sets of feelings that last for a while - like a pleasure seeking set of feelings. That is different from laughter or amusement, this is a strong specific mode that brings up a set of feelings for someone. Maybe someone else has a different sort of mode - maybe they have a strong mode where they feel guilty, and they have a unique set of feelings and thoughts that are with this mode.</item>
<item>Some of these modes might be a reflective mode, where you are in period that is reminiscent of the activity you were just doing. Other modes might be powerful ones, abusive ones, submissive or dominant ones, calm ones. It is as if someone gets in a 'mood' for these modes. Moods are more quiet however, and there are only a few moods that people recognize. However, there could be many different unique moods as well. What then is the difference between a mood and a mode? In a mood you have different emotions, maybe someone gets in an abusive mood. That would be like getting in an abusive mode. I think it is just a matter of how strong the mood or mode is. Moods are probably less strong than modes, and modes are also ways of acting, not just ways of feeling. In a mode the emotions are so strong that they influence your behavior - the emotion motivates thought. </item>
<item>One emotion can lead or transition into another emotion. For instance, someone can rage, then become angry instead of being in a rage over a certain thing, and then the emotion could die to down to the person just being hateful at whatever the cause is. That is similar to if someone is punched, they might be at first angry, then upset, and then depressed or sad. Anger can lead to hate, or 'being upset' - and then after that the emotion might transition into sadness or whatever might follow someone being hateful. Maybe the lesser emotion of hate is bitterness. So they would go from being hateful to being bitter. Or maybe if someone is talking to them positively, they could go from being hateful to being happy or optimistic.</item></list><para id="daelete_me">An explanation for this chapter:</para><para id="eip-14205">An emotional state is a very complicated thing. If someone knew completely their emotional state, they would know everything they were feeling right then. Then they wouldn't really have any "unconscious" emotions, because they would be perfectly conscious of what they were feeling. But then again, it is impossible to feel the full force of all your feelings at once, so it is not possible to be completely conscious of all your feelings. Your unconscious feelings must be dimmed down, or only large in a way that isn't completely conscious. Like you know you have a large emotion, but aren't in touch with it. </para><para id="eip-6340">Emotional states are complicated, it would be easy to say, "my emotional state right now is really messed up" because that is what emotional states are like, people have several emotions they are experiencing all the time, it is just hard to identify that this is occurring because I would say that people can only identify when they have a large, clear emotion that they can understand. </para>

<para id="delente_me">The internet encyclopedia of philosophy has a good entry on higher order theories of consciousness. Here<footnote id="exabmple-footnote">Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Entry by Paula Droege. Retrieved from http://www.iep.utm.edu/consc-hi/ 7/2/14</footnote> they reference a theory of Rosenthals:</para><list id="eip-288" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>According to Rosenthal’s higher-order thought theory (1986, 1997, 2005), a mental state is conscious when there is a higher-order thought about it. I am conscious of the pain in my knee when I have a thought to the effect that I am in that very pain state.</item></list><list id="eip-905" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>... A third important feature of higher-order thoughts on Rosenthal’s account is that they are assertoric and occurrent. The higher-order thought must assert, rather than hope, fear or speculate that I am in a particular mental state. Moreover, the higher-order thought must occur at roughly the same time as the mental state it represents. The content of the higher-order thought should be, for example: “I am now feeling pain,” not “I might have felt pain yesterday” or “Perhaps I will feel pain in a few minutes.” Rosenthal (1997) has argued that higher-order thoughts must be occurrent in order to distinguish between non-conscious and conscious states. If the mere disposition to produce a higher-order thought were sufficient for a mental state to be conscious, it seems that all one’s mental states would always be conscious.</item>
</list><para id="eip-646">Of course if someone has a thought about the pain they are experiencing the pain is going to be more conscious. It obviously depends on the situation if the thought makes the pain worse or less. I suppose a thought could make the pain less, but it would also make you more conscious and more aware of this lessened, (but more conscious) pain.</para><para id="eip-283">A model is proposed in the below image (B. Timmermans, et all), this is in the abstract of their paper:</para><list id="eip-2" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Metacognition is usually construed as a conscious, intentional process whereby people reflect upon
their own mental activity. Here, we instead suggest that metacognition is but an instance of a larger
class of representational re-description processes that we assume occur unconsciously and automatically.
From this perspective, the brain continuously and unconsciously learns to anticipate the
consequences of action or activity on itself, on the world and on other people through three predictive
loops: an inner loop, a perception–action loop and a self–other (social cognition) loop, which
together form a tangled hierarchy.</item>

The inner loop of the first order network is about the brain learning about the world, first there is stimuli and then brain thinks about the stimuli. When the brain thinks about the stimuli it forms meta-cognitions and has a secondary response from its initial response. </para><para id="eip-654">The 'inner loop' or their first-order network, is basically the brain thinking about the stimulus, and part of the meta-cognition (the 'thinking about the thinking') is two other loops, a perception-action loop and a self-other loop (social cognition). This means that the brain thinks more deeply about everything a second time, basically. Two of the things that it thinks more deeply about are perceptions of actions, and general social cognitions about the self and other people.</para><para id="eip-978">It makes sense that the mind has different levels of thinking. There is a more simple way of thinking about the world and there is a more complicated way of thinking. When anything is thought about, there is a more simplistic way of thinking about it and a more complicated way of thinking about it. It might be that a human cannot understand the idea or whatever you are thinking about if it is too complicated, in which case the simple level of your mind would be the only level that understands it.</para><para id="eip-975">I would say that the lower level of mind which isn't as intelligent or sophisticated as the its higher level is the initial, more animalistic response. What does that mean for sensation versus thought, however? Is there are lower level of feeling pain and a higher level? When someones mind is in the lower mode, how would it think different from its higher mode? It would probably have its higher-level social cognitions shut off. - So it wouldn't be capable of responding intelligently to other people, etc.</para><para id="eip-918"><title>Two types of consciousness</title>So there are two different types of consciousness - one type is awareness of physical sensations, and the other type is high-order or lower-order thought.

In that case it would be in a lower level state.</para><para id="eip-43">So it makes sense that pain medication would also make someone think less clearly - that is because they are in a lower physical and mental state (both physical sensations and mental thinking are dulled).</para></section><section id="eip-6777"><title>Types of Thinking</title><para id="eip-60">
The two different levels of mind (a dulled, more simplistic level and a sophisticated, higher order thought level) mean that in each level, a person is thinking differently.

It isn't clear what that means exactly though. Top-down or bottom-up thinking usually refers to a specific way of analyzing something, not to how someone thinks in general. Though if you consider how someone might think if they aren't being as intelligent, it makes me wonder if they might be more abstract and reach broad, not supported by any evidence conclusions first ('top-down') and ignore details. I could say that some people do that without thinking less than they usually do as well, however.</para><para id="eip-954">What are the higher levels of thought that are shut off when someone can't think clearly?

Does a humans mind make representations of the world? I would say that your minds biochemistry determines what you are going to feel when you experience anything. You see the color red, and your minds biology determines how that makes you feel, not necessarily what you are thinking about it. However, since emotions and feelings are very complex then what influences your feeling when you see the color red might be mental, psychological factors. For instance, you get mad when you see red because it reminds you of blood, or something.
</para><para id="eip-715">The internet encyclopedia of philosophy also has a good entry on “Consciousness”. They talk about higher order representation – which is basically a person being aware of their own consciousness at any given time, or aware of anything at any given time. For instance, if I am aware of my feelings on a certain matter, then I am more conscious of that matter. That seems fairly obvious, I mean if you think about something more you are going to be more conscious of it. This relates to the two different levels of thought and feeling – the lower level is more unconscious and immediate and less under control, and the higher level of consciousness is part of conscious experience and people are more aware of because it isn’t ‘unconscious’ it is ‘conscious’. So what separates out the two different levels of consciousness is one is mostly beneath awareness and would be defined as being unconscious, and the other is largely in awareness and would be defined as being conscious. There is clearly an overlap between conscious thoughts and feelings and unconscious thoughts and feelings, however – there are degrees that someone’s awareness is ‘awake’ and ‘clear’. Have I presented here a theory of consciousness? It is obvious that there are degrees to awareness, and all I have said is that consciousness is basically a combination of feelings and thoughts - that is a rather simple explanation of consciousness. Is there more explanation that is needed in order to answer what consciousness really is?:</para><list id="eip-449" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>As we have seen, one question that should be answered by any theory of consciousness is: What makes a mental state a conscious mental state? There is a long tradition that has attempted to understand consciousness in terms of some kind of higher-order awareness. For example, John Locke (1689/1975) once said that “consciousness is the perception of what passes in a man’s own mind.” This intuition has been revived by a number of philosophers (Rosenthal, 1986, 1993b, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2005; Gennaro 1996a, 2012; Armstrong, 1968, 1981; Lycan, 1996, 2001). In general, the idea is that what makes a mental state conscious is that it is the object of some kind of higher-order representation (HOR). A mental state M becomes conscious when there is a HOR of M. A HOR is a “meta-psychological” state, i.e., a mental state directed at another mental state. So, for example, my desire to write a good encyclopedia entry becomes conscious when I am (non-inferentially) “aware” of the desire. Intuitively, it seems that conscious states, as opposed to unconscious ones, are mental states that I am “aware of” in some sense. This is sometimes referred to as the Transitivity Principle. Any theory which attempts to explain consciousness in terms of higher-order states is known as a higher-order (HO) theory of consciousness. It is best initially to use the more neutral term “representation” because there are a number of different kinds of higher-order theory, depending upon how one characterizes the HOR in question. HO theories, thus, attempt to explain consciousness in mentalistic terms, that is, by reference to such notions as “thoughts” and “awareness.” Conscious mental states arise when two unconscious mental states are related in a certain specific way; namely, that one of them (the HOR) is directed at the other (M).<footnote id="exabbmple-footnote">Consciousness. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Entry by Rocco J. Gennaro. Retrieved from http://www.iep.utm.edu/consciou/ 7/8/14</footnote></item></list><para id="eip-151">So a mental state can be unconscious or conscious. If someone is sleeping and dreaming, then their mental state would be considered to unconscious. I would say that there is a lot to say about how ‘aware’ someone is at any time. If someone is drugged or drunk, are they less aware of their interactions with other people? I said previously that they might not be responding as intelligently to other people. I wouldn’t guess as to how exactly their cognitions or emotional response is dulled – there could be a wide range of emotional, personality and intellectual dispositions that someone could have that could be affected. That shows how awareness in general, not necessarily when someone has lower general awareness like when they are sleeping or drunk, is influenced to different degrees.</para><para id="eip-150">What is the difference between our unconscious awareness and our conscious awareness then? Here again is the internet encyclopedia of philosophy – they address the question of differences between HO (high order) and LO (lower-order) mental states, which I have said is basically the difference between conscious states and unconscious ones:</para><list id="eip-724" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>A fourth important objection to HO approaches is the question of how such theories can explain cases where the HO state might misrepresent the lower-order (LO) mental state (Byrne 1997, Neander 1998, Levine 2001, Block 2011). After all, if we have a representational relation between two states, it seems possible for misrepresentation or malfunction to occur. If it does, then what explanation can be offered by the HO theorist? If my LO state registers a red percept and my HO state registers a thought about something green due, say, to some neural misfiring, then what happens? It seems that problems loom for any answer given by a HO theorist and the cause of the problem has to do with the very nature of the HO theorist’s belief that there is a representational relation between the LO and HO states. For example, if the HO theorist takes the option that the resulting conscious experience is reddish, then it seems that the HO state plays no role in determining the qualitative character of the experience. On the other hand, if the resulting experience is greenish, then the LO state seems irrelevant. Rosenthal and Weisberg hold that the HO state determines the qualitative properties even in cases when there is no LO state at all (Rosenthal 2005, 2011, Weisberg 2008, 2011a, 2011b). Gennaro (2012) argues that no conscious experience results in such cases and wonders, for example, how a sole (unconscious) HOT can result in a conscious state at all. He argues that there must be a match, complete or partial, between the LO and HO state in order for a conscious state to exist in the first place.</item></list><para id="eip-261">The mind must have an unconscious understanding of the world and a conscious understanding of the world, and that is what accounts for differences in higher-order (conscious) and lower-order (unconscious) mental states. Or I could say that there is simply a difference between how a human responds unconsciously, and how a human responds consciously to experiences and stimuli.</para><para id="eip-338">What is the difference between an unconscious response and a conscious response then, however? Unconscious responses are affective - they are faster and more immediate than conscious responses. Unconscious responses are also what your brain has programmed in from previous development. Conscious responses, however, are more so under your control and thoughts can help to change a conscious response.</para><para id="eip-531">What if someone’s conscious response differs from their unconscious response? What would be an example of that happening? All responses are unconscious unless someone tries to change their response. For example, people often try to change their feelings by inhibiting them or encouraging them.</para><para id="eip-143">Saying all responses are higher-order or conscious doesn’t make sense, because people are constantly influenced by natural emotional processes. First comes natural unconscious responses, and if you want to change or think about your situation, you ‘think’ and make the response more conscious.</para><para id="eip-8">So basically humans have emotional and intellectual responses to experience and stimuli. It is hard to influence your emotIONS WITH THOUGHT; HOWEVER PEOPLE ATTEMPT TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME (CONSCIOUSLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY).</para></section>
